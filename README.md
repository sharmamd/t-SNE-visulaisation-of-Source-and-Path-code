To the visualization of path and source codes. We employ t-distributed stochastic neighbor  embedding~\citep[t-SNE]{van2008visualizing, wattenberg2016how}, a technique that projects the high-dimensional 
latent codes onto a more manageable two-dimensional (2D) space. While interpreting the lower-dimensional projections remains challenging, the resulting scatter plots unveil well-separated clusters of points. Each cluster signifies 
seismograms sharing common source and path features. Analyzing whether seismograms from different earthquakes cluster together or form distinct clusters provides valuable insights into the similarity or dissimilarity of source or path effects between the earthquakes.
This visualization approach provides a powerful tool for exploring the complex relationships between earthquakes and understanding how latent codes correlate with distinct source characteristics.
